While on the menu, click which level you'd like to play. In easy, the obstacles will move slower across the screen. As you increase difficulty the obstacles will move quicker.

Once in a level, wait till the countdown to begin moving. 

Once Waddles begins to run, you will use the UP arrow key to jump over seals and ice blocks and the DOWN arrow key to duck under snow balls.

In order to win the game and get Waddles home, there is a max score of 10,000 for each level. 

If you hit an obstacle though, Waddles dies and you need to start over. You'll notice your high score being tracked, try to keep getting a better score!

If you forget any of these instructions, click "HELP" in the top right corner of the menu! Have fun!
